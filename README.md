# Data Structure 2025

An archive of my journey through the **Data Structure** course I completed in early 2025, based on the book *Advanced Topics in C* by Noel Kalicharan.

Check out my [final project!](/final_project/)

## About

This repository contains my implementations of key data structure concepts and problems, written in C. It builds on my earlier foundational work in [Fundamental Programming 2024](https://github.com/ilhmpbta/fundamental-programming-2024), and reflects how I gradually leveled up my coding and problem-solving skills.

Although this repo mainly serves as a personal archive, it might be helpful if you're just getting started with data structures or working through the same book.

## Topics Covered

- Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)  
- Stacks and queues  
- Trees (binary trees, BSTs)  
- Graphs (basic traversal, representation)  
- Recursion and its applications  
- Sorting and searching algorithms  
- Custom data types and memory management

## Progress

I wrapped up this course after completing my fundamentals class, and this repo is a snapshot of what I learned during that time. I'm still improving and refactoring some of the older solutions.
